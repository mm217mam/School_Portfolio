## This repo is to demonstrate my abilities in data science from school assignments from undergrad and grad school.  All work is original.

## There are 3 folders to demonstrate what I've learned and understand even if I cannot code 100% of this off the top of my head:
	 1. Coding_Skills:  
 			Python
	 		R
	 		SQL (MySQL, Azure, pgAdmin)
	 		SAS
	 		PySpark for big data
		
	 2. Visuals_Stats
			using Python, R and SQL and various packages.
	 
	 3. Modeling_Learning
			Regression Techniques
	 		Trees and Random Forests
			Clustering
	 		Neural Networks
			Reinforcement Learning 
	 		Deep Learning
